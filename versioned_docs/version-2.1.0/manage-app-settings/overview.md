### Allow beta versions

This option is available in the `General` section of the settings page.

Enable this setting to allow FAIRshare to download beta versions of the application. Beta versions may not yet be stable and may contain bugs but you will be able to preview and test the latest features ahead of time.

This option is available in the `Advanced` section of the settings page.

In here you will be able to open the folder where the configuration files are stored.
