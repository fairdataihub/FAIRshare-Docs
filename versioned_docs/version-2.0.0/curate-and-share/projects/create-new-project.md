## Background

From this page you will be able to create a new project. Think of projects as a set of data that you are planning on making FAIR. Each project will require a name and a description so that you will be able to identify it later.

## How to

- Add a name and description to your project
- Select the data you want to upload
- Click on the `Create new project` button
