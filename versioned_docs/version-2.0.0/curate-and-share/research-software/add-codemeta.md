## Background

In order to make your research software FAIR, we will need to create a `codemeta.json` file in either your local folder or on your GitHub repository. This is a mandatory step in the FAIRifying process. This step has been divided into seven different sections that you can complete. Not every field is required but all fields are mandatory if available.

:::info
The data you provide in this step will also be used to generate a `CITATION.CFF` file. This file is used to allow other researchers to easily cite your research software.
