Within this page you will be able to select a GitHub repository that you would like to use as your data source. You will need to have a GitHub account to use this feature.

:::info
Currently data repositories only support public repositories. You will be shown a list of all the repositories but you will only be able to select repositories that are public on GitHub.

:::note
You might need to connect FAIRshare to GitHub to see the list of repositories.

## How to

- Wait for all your repositories to load.
- Select the repository that you would like to use.
- You can view all the file in the repository by clicking on the `View files in repository` button. Clicking on any of the items within the list will open the file directly on GitHub.
- Click on the `Continue` button.

:::caution
FAIRshare will only use the default branch of the repository. Please make sure that all the data that you would like to share is in your default branch.
