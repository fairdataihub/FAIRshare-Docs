FAIRshare has been designed with the user in mind. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

There are three key sections within FAIRshare:

1. Curate & Share

   The first section is the `Curate & Share` section. This section is where you can upload your data and share it with other researchers. This is the primary section within the app and this is where you will be spending most of your time.  
   Click on the `Curate & Share` section within the sidebar to begin.

2. Manage Accounts

   The second section is the `Manage Accounts` section. This section is where you can manage your repository integrations. At the moment only Zenodo and GitHub are supported.  
   Click on the `Manage Accounts` section within the sidebar to manage your integrations.

3. Settings

   The final section is the `Settings` section. This section is where you can manage your app settings.  
   Click on the `Settings` section within the sidebar to manage your app settings.

## Notes

- The window size of the application frame can be easily adjusted to fit your screen by dragging the borders.
- Closing the interface will stop any on-going process (dataset organization, uploading, etc).
- A pop-up message will appear when launching the app if a newer version is available for download.
- Tooltips are used throughout the interface to provide users with additional information.
