## Settings

At this moment, we only provide access to one user controllable setting. Keep an eye out for more in the future.

### Allow beta versions

This option is available in the `General` section of the settings page.

Enable this setting to allow FAIRshare to download beta versions of the application. Beta versions may not yet be stable and may contain bugs but you will be able to preview and test the latest features ahead of time.

### Configuration folder

This option is available in the `Advanced` section of the settings page.

In here you will be able to open the folder where the configuration files are stored.

### Logs folder

This option is available in the `Advanced` section of the settings page.

In here you will be able to open the folder where some of log files of the FAIRshare backend service are stored. This option is only needed if the developer team needs access to your log files.
