If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

### Controls for do-not-track features

Most operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
