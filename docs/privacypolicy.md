# Privacy Policy

In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.

#### Last revised date

### Why do we collect information?

Tracking is implemented as part of our agreement with the SPARC program to report usage statistics for our application and related documentation. Tracking is also used to spot errors and subsequently improve user experience.

### What information do we collect?

We automatically collect certain information when you launch, use, or navigate SODA (the `App` or `Application`). This information is collected **anonymously** and does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, operating system, information about how you use SODA, and other technical information.

For a detailed list regarding what information is tracked within SODA please refer to [What do we track?](#what-do-we-track).

We employ the use of Google Analytics to track and log user events within SODA. To learn more, please visit their [Terms of service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/).

### How do we use the collected information?

We use the information we collect in various ways, including to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain our website and application
- Improve, personalize, and expand our website and application
- Understand and analyze how you use our website and application

- Find and prevent fraud

### Will the collected information be shared with anyone?

Collected information will be shared with the SPARC management team. It may also be shared with other SPARC-funded groups as well as displayed on our [website](https://fairdataihub.org/sodaforsparc).

### Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

We use Google's Universal Analytics program to track anonymized user interactions within SODA. To learn more about the technologies used please refer to [Security and privacy in Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2838718?hl=en).

On this documentation platform, Fair Data Innovations Hub uses cookies. These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.

### Log files

Fair Data Innovations Hub follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.

### Advertising Partners Privacy Policies

### How long do we keep the collected information?

We will only keep collected usage data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

### How do we keep the collected data safe?

Collected information is completely anonymized. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cyber-criminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your information, the transmission of personal information to and from SODA is always a possible risk. You should only access SODA within a secure environment.

### CCPA Privacy Rights

Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to:

- Request that a business that collects a consumer's personal data disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.
- Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.
- Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.
- If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

Fair Data Innovations Hub does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

### What are your privacy rights?

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

### Controls for do-not-track features

Most operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

### Do California residents have specific privacy rights?

_In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information._

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data. To request the removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include a statement that you reside in California.

The updated version will be indicated by an updated [revised date](#last-revised-date) and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
