SODA for COVID-19 Research may work on other Debian based distributions but we have not tested compatibility at this time.
:::

1. <DownloadURL os="linux">Download the Linux AppImage</DownloadURL>
2. Right-click on the downloaded file and go to the permissions tab.
3. Click `Allow executing file as program` and make sure it is enabled.
4. Double click the downloaded SODA app icon and it should open the app.

Since our Linux SODA app is in the AppImage format, you can move this file anywhere on your computer and run it. If you would like to move the app into the applications older, we recommend you use the open-source [AppImage Launcher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to organize and handle all AppImage programs for your Linux system.
